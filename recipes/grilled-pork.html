    <h2>Kontosoubli</h2>
    <p><img src="../images/pork.jpeg" alt="Kontosoubli"></p>
    <p>  Kontosoubli is a popular Greek food consisting of pieces of meat and sometimes vegetables grilled on a skewer/spit.
        It is usually eaten straight off the skewer while still hot. It can be served with or inside of a rolled pita, 
        typically with lemon, sauces, vegetables such as sliced tomato and onion, and fried potatoes as a side.
        The meat usually used in Greece and Cyprus is pork, although chicken, beef, and lamb may also be used
        there and elsewhere. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>1kg pork</li>
        <li>200g onion </li>
        <li>300g bell peppers</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Execution</h2>
        <ol><li>Cut all your ingredients on 8cm^2 X 2 cubes</li>
            <li>Heavily salt them </li>
            <li>Start impaling them on the spit</li>
            <li>The rotation should be, fatty meat into onion into meat into bell pepper</li>
            </ol>

    <p> TIP: Try to have fatty meats equidistributed!</p>
