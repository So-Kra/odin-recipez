    <h2>Lasagna</h2>
    <p><img src="../images/index.jpeg" alt="Lasagna"></p>
    <p>  Lasagne are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,[2] made of very wide, flat sheets.
    Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as rag√π (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil.[3] The dish may be topped with
    grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically, cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and 
    then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into single-serving square portions. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>500g minced beef(ideally young)</li>
        <li>200g roma tomatoes (Kiknos is a brand I prefer) </li>
        <li>500g all purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>100g parmesan</li>
        <li>400g mozzarella</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Execution</h2>
        <ol><li>Fry the minced meat on some olive oil</li>
            <li>Add the roma tomatoes to create a ragu, and let it simmer for 20 minutes </li>
            <li>Add spice on the ragu (cinnamon, salt, pepper)</li>
            <li>In the meantime make the pasta layers, by combining the flour, the eggs and some olive oil. Let it rest until the ragu is ready.</li>
            <li>Add mozzarela in between layers on top of the ragu. Grate the parmessan on top and insert in the oven for 35' 200 C.</li>
            </ol>
